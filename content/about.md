## Carey Mogianesi

    Carey Mogianesi was born in Atlanta Georgia June 2nd 1992 and grew up in the city of Duluth, but, in 2006, her family migrated to Augusta Georgia. Since childhood, Carey has been active in the arts and knew she would be an artist at a young age. Carey received her Bachelors of Fine Arts with a concentration in Studio Arts and a minor in museum studies at Augusta University in Augusta Georgia. She took her first ceramics class in 2014 and fell in love with the natural material of clay. She pursued it as her main media focus and created her business Third Eye Ceramics. Carey believes that travel is an important aspect of any artist life and has taken it upon herself to travel nationally and internationally in order to experience the impact of cultural acceptance and understanding. In Careyâ€™s artwork, there are direct connections between her southern culture and the power that travel has had in her life.

    She is currently working on the pot person series that was started back in the fall of 2016. She combines wheel-thrown utilitarian vessels with humanoid facial features and limbs. She creates these figures based on her interest and influences from Southern Folk pottery face jugs and her attraction to figurative sculptures she visited in Europe. Carey strives to create sculptures that evoke a presence or a sense of being rather than a stagnant and lifeless thing. The pots exterior surface and pigment emit a sense of human flesh that allows the viewer to become more empathetic to the expression and gesture. This romantic melancholic captivation entices a viewer to explore the pot person up close where he/she is then able to peer inside to experience a world of rich color as if it were the sculptures inner personality.

    Carey is a strong believer in how art can transform a community and strives to participate in public art practices that impact individuals in a positive way. Currently Carey is working on a project called Open Canvas which strives to bring the appreciation of public art to the city of Augusta where she currently lives. This project was created in the fall of 2016 and will hopefully come to fruition by the end of summer in 2017. Carey has been in several other notable projects. She organized a pinch pot event for children at the Morris Museum of art in Augusta, GA, for their event called Artzilla back in 2016. Carey also participated and organized the Forever Pumpkins event with fellow members of Mad Potters Organization and Tire City Potters to create a fun free project for the women and children living and receiving help from Save Homes of Augusta in 2015. The project was submitted to Across the Table, Across the Land, which was designed by National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts (NCECA), and was recognized with distinction in the 2016 conference held in Kansas, MO.
