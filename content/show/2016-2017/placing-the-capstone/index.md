The Steffen Thomas Museum of Art is proud to announce the opening reception of Placing the Capstone III, the second annual College Connections exhibition featuring graduating studio art majors from Professor Kristin Casaletto’s Capstone Class at Augusta University.   Ten artists will be showcased in this group show that is part of the Museum’s College Connections program, one module of STMA’s Art$mart Project.  The works include paintings, photography, sculpture and ceramics and range from representational still life to portraiture, to surrealist and abstract interpretations of various subjects.
 
One of the objectives of the Art$mart Project is to give students the opportunity and motivation to market their art.  Most of the works in this show will be for sale and offer the chance for collectors of works from up and coming to add to their collections.  This is an excellent resume-building experience for these young artists and it affords them the chance to talk to the public about their work and plans for the future.  STMA is so pleased to welcome these hard working creatives and are most grateful to Professor Casaletto for her enthusiasm for the relationship between the museum and her class.
