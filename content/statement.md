# Artist Statement

My artwork focuses on the body as a vessel and characteristics of the human body. Travel and exploration have become important facets of my developing body of artwork. Like artist before me, travel is a way in which I engage diverse cultures and, in an integral way, implement those elements of inspiration into my artwork. 
<br>
<br>
My art is influenced by Greek figurative sculpture and elements of folk ceramic pottery. By weave together elements of both cultures, I brought to fruition my humanoid pottery creations. I believe these vessels are a way for me to heal myself from the past and provide a sacred space for reflection.  I use clay as a material because of my attraction to it as a natural material and its dexterity. 
<br>
<br>
 I join wheel-thrown vessels and human features to create a utilitarian object that presents themselves as an active being rather than stagnates thing.  Each creation, unique from each other, displays subtle personal emotions and gestures that subconsciously bubble to the surface from my inner self-projections. My vessels do not represent a specific gender or race because I want very one to be able to relate to my vessels and as a way to negate our cultures prejudice tendencies. The humanoid-vessels reverberate elements of internal and external beauty. Exterior application of Iron oxides allowed the clay body to resemble a unique skin resemblance that engages the viewer to become more involved in the piece. As the viewer engages closer, they are able to see the combination of glazes that uniquely set each vessel apart, as if it were its own personality. These elements help provide a bridge in which the vessel and viewer become interlocked in an empathetic way. As if, they were a part of our world and more like ourselves.
