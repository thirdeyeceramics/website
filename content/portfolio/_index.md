My artwork focuses on the body as a vessel and characteristics of the human body. Travel and exploration have become important facets of my developing body of artwork. Like artist before me, travel is a way in which I engage diverse cultures and, in an integral way, implement those elements of inspiration into my artwork. 
<br>
<br>
My art is influenced by Greek figurative sculpture and elements of folk ceramic pottery. By weave together elements of both cultures, I brought to fruition my humanoid pottery creations. I believe these vessels are a way for me to heal myself from the past and provide a sacred space for reflection.  I use clay as a material because of my attraction to it as a natural material and its dexterity. 
<br>
<br>
 I join wheel-thrown vessels and human features to create a utilitarian object that presents themselves as an active being rather than stagnates thing.  Each creation, unique from each other, displays subtle personal emotions and gestures that subconsciously bubble to the surface from my inner self-projections. My vessels do not represent a specific gender or race because I want very one to be able to relate to my vessels and as a way to negate our cultures prejudice tendencies. The humanoid-vessels reverberate elements of internal and external beauty. Exterior application of Iron oxides allowed the clay body to resemble a unique skin resemblance that engages the viewer to become more involved in the piece. As the viewer engages closer, they are able to see the combination of glazes that uniquely set each vessel apart, as if it were its own personality. These elements help provide a bridge in which the vessel and viewer become interlocked in an empathetic way. As if, they were a part of our world and more like ourselves.

My Homeless Homes was a project designed to engage the economic issues of homelessness and the empty and decaying properties in the United States. There are 3.5 Million AmericasÂ who are homeless and living on the streets, in cars, in homeless shelters, or in subsidized transitions housing. And in America, there is over 18.6 Million homes that are empty. This is alarming because the homes could be used to house the homeless and end the crisis here in America, but nothing is being done about it and no one seems to care. 
<br>
<br>
The houses are slab built and assembled together. I use humanoid faces that help the viewer become more empathetic the message the piece itself. I place elements of broken and closed homes that resemble the damage inflicted onto the American homeless civilians. A house is not a home unless someone is living in it. These homes are hollow and represent the dark realities that still remain a crisis in the 21st century in our first world country.
